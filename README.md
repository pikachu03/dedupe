# Dedupe
A python script to identify duplicate files in a given directory

## To Use
Download or clone the repository. Then, direct your terminal to the downloaded/cloned directory and run as you would any other python script (`python dedupe.py`)

Please note: I made this program to run on MacOS. It will need to be modified to work on windows and may need to be modified to work with linux.

This program was written using python 2.7. Minor changes may be needed to work with newever versions of python.
