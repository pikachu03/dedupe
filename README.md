# Dedupe
A python script to identify duplicate files in a given directory

## To Use
Download or clone the repository. Then, in your terminal, cd to the directory and run "python dedupe.py"

Please note: I made this program to run on MacOS. I don't know how it will run on other operating systems.

Also, this program was made to run with python 2.7. It currently doesn't work with python 3.x.
